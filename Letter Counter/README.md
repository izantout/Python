# Letter Counter
Python code that imports a text file, counts the frequency of each upper case letter, each lower case letter, 
sorts the file alphabetically, and each special character, and outputs a histogram showing the different letters and how much they were used. 
The program was also able to remove any duplicate words, check and return the position of the required word, check words, and determine if they 
are anagrams or not. In addition to multiple other functions that were required in that project.
